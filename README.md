# GRAPH-BASED-TEXT-SUMMARY-
Finding the summary of a text and the similarity ratio between the actual summary and the found summary using the rouge score


Neo4j graph database was used as database in the project.

Bert Algorithm was used in the project.BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), natural language processing (NLP)
It is a deep learning-based language model used in the field.

Cosine similarity was used to calculate inter-sentence similarity.

The similarity between the summary resulting from the algorithm and the actual summary of the text is calculated with the ROUGE score.
The ROUGE score is a method used to measure the similarity of two texts. This similarity is usually based on whether words found in the reference text are also found in the summarized text.
